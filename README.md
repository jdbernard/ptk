# Personal Time Keeper

`ptk` is a small utility to log time entries. It uses a simple conceptual model
and a simple JSON data format.

A ptk timeline is made up of a series of ptk entries, or marks. Each mark has a
summary, a timestamp, and a universally unique id (generated by `ptk`).
Additionally a mark may be tagged with an arbitrary number of tags and may have
detailed notes attached to it (anything representable in plain text).

The duration of a task is calculated by taking the difference between that
task's timestamp and the one following it chronologically. The `STOP` value as
a summary serves as a sentinal to indicate that an entry has been completed
and no new entry is being tracked.
